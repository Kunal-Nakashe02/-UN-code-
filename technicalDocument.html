    <h2>What is Java?</h2>
<p> Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades,
        with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself.
        It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

       <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

    <h2 id="obj">Object and Classes :</h2>
    <h3 style="background-color:rgb(175, 180, 241);">Object -</h3>
<p>Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.

    Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.
    
    Take a minute right now to observe the real-world objects that are in your immediate area. For each object that you see, ask yourself two questions: "What possible states can this object be in?" and "What possible behavior can this object perform?". Make sure to write down your observations. As you do, you'll notice that real-world objects vary in complexity; your desktop lamp may have only two possible states (on and off) and two possible behaviors (turn on, turn off), but your desktop radio might have additional states (on, off, current volume, current station) and behavior (turn on, turn off, increase volume, decrease volume, seek, scan, and tune). You may also notice that some objects, in turn, will also contain other objects. These real-world observations all translate into the world of object-oriented programming.

    Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation — a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.
    
</p>

    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(175, 180, 241);">Class -</h3>

<p>Class variables or static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class. They are similar to instance variables,
         but they are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.The main difference with instance variables is in what scope they are available. 
         A class variable is accessible from an object instance, while an instance variable is not accessible from a class method.
</p>
        
    <h2 id="inh">Inhertance :</h2>
    <p>Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

    The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
        
    Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
    </p>

    <h2 id="pol">Polymorphism :</h2>
    <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 

        Real-life Illustration: Polymorphism
        
        A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. 
        Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 
        The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

    <h4>Types of polymorphism -</h4>


<p>In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: </p>
<ol><li>Compile-time Polymorphism</li>
<li>Runtime Polymorphism</li></ol>

Type 1: Compile-time polymorphism

It is also known as static polymorphism. 
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. 
</p>

<p>Subtypes of Compile-time Polymorphism:
<ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li >Function Overloading: It is a feature in C++ where multiple functions can have the same name but with different parameter lists. The compiler will decide which function to call based on the number and types of arguments passed to the function.</li>
    <li>Operator Overloading: It is a feature in C++ where the operators such as +, -, * etc. can be given additional meanings when applied to user-defined data types.</li>
    <li>template: it is a powerful feature in C++ that allows us to write generic functions and classes. A template is a blueprint for creating a family of functions or classes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Type 2: Runtime polymorphism</p>

It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
</p>

<h2 id="abs">Abstraction :</h2>
<p>Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information.
     The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. 
     Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. 
     It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.
</p>

<h2 id="enc" >Encapsulation :</h2>
<p>Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

    encapsulation in java
    We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
    
    The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
    
    Advantage of Encapsulation in Java
    By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only. In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
    Play Video
    
    
    It provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside the setter method. You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.
    
    It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
    
    The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.
    
    The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters. So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.
